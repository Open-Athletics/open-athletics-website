> _OpenTrack CG_ was renamed __Open Athletics__ to clarify this community's scope, purpose and operation.

The **Open Athletics** Community Group —formerly *OpenTrack Community Group*, but changed to make the scope broader—, aims at creating a toolset to increase interoperability among systems managing information on athletics and sports in general. Open Athletics includes schemes and vocabularies to describe sports, as well as open source software that helps managing that kind of information.

Through OpenTrack and Open Athletics, entities around the world (sport clubs, federations, private event organizers, etc.) will be able to open the data contributing towards open data in sports. This will bring new business opportunities to third parties (developers, public bodies, private companies, citizens, academia).

In order to maximize the impact and adoption of the final proposal, this initiative is supported by [European Athletics](http://www.european-athletics.org) and other [relevant institutions](https://www.w3.org/community/opentrack/participants) of the world of *Data Management* and *Athletics*.

Read the [official Charter](https://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/charter.html) for more information about this group.

## What tools?

The main component we develop is a set of vocabularies and taxonomies that will help publishers to model and expose information regarding athletics (events, athletes, facilities, results, rankings, and others).

Participants in this group will contribute with code recipes, libraries, and examples about the use of athletics information.

Currently, we are working on what we call it, **Open Athletics** models, vocabularies, and tools: 

* A **[Conceptual Data Model for Athletics](https://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/spec/model/)** to define Athletics competitions, events, management and participation in an abstract way; and
* a **[Sports Competition Data Model and Vocabulary](https://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/spec/competition/)** based on Schema.org. It contains examples of implementation for competitions, participation, athletes, organizations, etc.
* some **[code examples](http://purl.org/athletics/codes)** to illustrate how to use the former vocabulary to describe entities (i.e., athletes, clubs, and federations), and competitions (i.e., disciplines, categories, events) and some useful codes and taxonomies for countries, in-competition features, etc.

## Formats and standards

All documents will be written in English and encoded in UTF-8.

Schemas and vocabularies will be aligned with the existing W3C standards, in concrete with the Data on the Web specifications. Although they will be described as abstract vocabularies, they will be also modeled in RDF.


## Can I use the tools and reports?

Of course you can! Unless the piece of software or document listed in this repository has specified an explicit license, everything is under the [W3C Software and Document License](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/2015/copyright-software-and-document). This means that, by default, you have permission to copy, modify, and distribute OpenTrack works, with or without modification, for any purpose and without fee or royalty.
