## Published documents 

Currently, we are working on what we call it, **Open Athletics** models, vocabularies, and tools: 

* A **[Conceptual Data Model for Athletics](https://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/spec/model/)** to define Athletics competitions, events, management and participation in an abstract way; and
* a **[Sports Competition Data Model and Vocabulary](https://w3c.github.io/opentrack-cg/spec/competition/)** based on Schema.org. It contains examples of implementation for competitions, participation, athletes, organizations, etc.

Participants in this group may contribute with code recipes, libraries, and examples about the use of athletics information.

You can find all the ongoing activities in [our public repository in Github](https://github.com/w3c/opentrack-cg).  


## Formats and standards

All documents will be written in English and encoded in UTF-8.

Schemas and vocabularies will be aligned with the existing W3C standards, in concrete with the Data on the Web specifications. Although they will be described as abstract vocabularies, they will be also modeled in RDF.

This work is based on previous works on sports data modeling, such as:

* IOC [ODF](http://odf.olympictech.org/2016-Rio/rio_2016_OG.htm)
* IPTC [SportsML](https://iptc.org/standards/sportsml-g2/). Vocabularies for sharing content (e.g., news) about sports in general. There are some specific vocabularies for concrete sports. Athletics is missing.
